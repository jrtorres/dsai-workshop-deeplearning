# Data & AI Workshop - Deep Learning

## Objective

This workshop will walk you through some of the fundamental early stages of the Data Science / ML workflow. We will be exploring different aspects of data understanding, visualization and processing. By the end of these labs/tutorials, you should understand:

- The use of Jupyter Notebooks in IBM Watson Studio
- How to load data sets with open source libraries
- How to visualize data sets through code and no-code options
- How to process data sets

### Tools Used

- Watson Studio [(docs)](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/welcome-main.html?audience=wdp)
- Watson Machine Learning [(docs)](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/docs/ibm-watson-machine-learning/get-started/)
- [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
- Several Python Libraries: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, [PixieDust](https://github.com/pixiedust/pixiedust)

## Requirements

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com)

## Workshop Flow

Most of these labs are written in python and using Jupyter Notebooks. One of the most common python libraries used for data analysis and manipulation is [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), which is used throughout the labs. For a quick tutorial around pandas, feel free to run through the material found here - [IBMDeveloperUK pandas-workshop](https://github.com/IBMDeveloperUK/pandas-workshop).

### Prerequisites

1. Store this repository on your local computer.

   If you have GIT on your machine, clone this repository locally. Open a terminal and run:
